\# Answers to the research questions



\## Answer to Question 1



\*Have wages in all sectors been rising over the years, or have they been falling in some sectors?\*



Over the years, wages have not been rising in all sectors, but have been falling in some. The specific years and sectors where wages have fallen can be viewed using the script \[question-1.sql](https://github.com/Sarka8/sql\_project/blob/main/question-1.sql)



\## Answer to Question 2



\*How many litres of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable period in the available price and wage data?\*



In 2006, an average wage and price could buy 1,297 kg of bread and 1,482 litres of milk. Whereas in 2018, it is already 1356 kg of bread and 1627 l of milk. Thus, wages have risen faster than the prices of these foods.



Thus, people could buy more bread and milk in 2018 than in 2006. Real purchasing power against these staple foods has increased.



\## Answer to Question 3



\*Which category of food is becoming more expensive at the slowest rate (lowest percentage increase year-on-year)?\*



"Crystalline sugar" posted an average year-on-year growth of -1.75%, meaning that on average it has become 1.75% cheaper each year - i.e. cheaper. "Paradise apples" posted an average year-on-year growth of -0.81% - i.e. it also became cheaper. "Yellow bananas" have become the slowest to appreciate in price, averaging 0.86% each year.



These 3 products have increased in price the slowest, or even gotten cheaper.



\## Answer to Question 4



\*Is there any year in which the annual increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?\*



There is no year in which the annual increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth. The highest annual increase in food prices compared to wage growth was in 2013, at 6.5%.



\## Answer to Question 5



\*Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if GDP rises more significantly in one year, does this translate into a more significant rise in food prices or wages in the same or the following year?\*



GDP and wages:

\- In 2006 GDP growth was 6.77% → the following year (2007) wages grew by 8.89%.

\- In 2008-2009, GDP declined significantly (as much as -4.66% in 2009) → wages slowed, but not negatively.

\- After years with negative or very low GDP growth (e.g. 2012: -0.79%), wages grew more weakly or stagnated (2013: -1.56%).



GDP and prices:

\- Not quite a direct relationship.

\- Eg: In 2009 GDP fell by -4.66% but prices rose by 2.08% → so prices are not directly linked to GDP.

\- 2012 had negative GDP, but prices continued to rise a year later (5.56% in 2013).



Lagged GDP effect:

\- Wages seem to respond more often to GDP with a one-year lag than prices.

\- E.g. GDP 5.39% in 2015 → wages 6.28% in 2016.



Conclusion:

\- Wages show some continuity with GDP - especially in periods of economic growth or crisis.

\- However, food prices are less directly affected by GDP growth - probably more dependent on external factors (e.g. commodity markets, inflation, seasonality).

\- It cannot be said that higher GDP automatically leads to higher prices. However, there is some correlation for wages, especially with a one-year lag.
